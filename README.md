# Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) — PID Implementation

Overview
--------
This project implements and evaluates a PID-based Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system and compares it to a traditional cruise control approach. ACC improves the driving experience by integrating both speed and distance control: it can maintain a target speed and also react to a lead vehicle by adjusting speed to preserve a safe following distance. Traditional cruise control only maintains a set speed and cannot react to other vehicles; if the lead vehicle slows, the driver must deactivate or cancel the system or apply the brakes manually.
